Welcome to Molly-next's documentation!
=========================================

The Molly Project is an open source batteries included framework for the
rapid development and deployment of mobile and desktop portals originally
developed by the University of Oxford. It was originally developed for
Higher Education institutions but is suitable in many other situations.

Powering every Molly site is a RESTful API which allows Molly to be used
as a basis to build other applications and frontends.

.. warning:: This documentation is for the Mollyproject-next fork of Molly. If you are looking for Molly 1.4, see
